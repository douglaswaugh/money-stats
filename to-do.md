get statsd working (https://github.com/etsy/statsd)
think about how we'd get the data in to statsd (projector?)

what I want to produce

profit of inflight projects to work out whether we should continue projects
profit of past projects to get an idea of what succesful projects look like 
profit generated by departments to prove that we're the best
..to work out if we should be working on different things

realtime profit of compare the market
realtime profit of go compare

realtime profit of call centre
realtime profit of dev team
 - realtime profit of api
 - realtime profit of ehl branded sites
 - realtime profit of partner sites 
  - realtime profit of barclays

realtime profit of price watch
realtime profit of market insight
realtime profit of refresh

ways that I could deliver it:
 - compile the numbers just in excel
